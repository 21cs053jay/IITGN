This repository contains all of the ML/DL models for all of the experiments performed during the internship period at IIT GANDHINAGAR. To import it in your device, use the following command: `git clone https://github.com/21cs053jay/IITGN.git`

# Etching Experiments involved creation of data using Sentaurus Topography tool and performed experiments were as follows: 
      ## 1. Initial Experiments for exploration and understanding the of the Sentaurus Topography tool.
      ## 2. Actual Replication of Channel Release in Gate All Around Field Effect Transistor (GAAFET).

Each of these experiments had their own importance in the project and contributed to the complete understanding of the software and ML/DL model for the actual experiment.
